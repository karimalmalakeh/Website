# Website
Using HTML and CSS, I created a fictional responsive website to offer scam prevention courses and provide counter-scam services for users that have gotten caught in a scam. It is called Karma's Calling, because karma is going to be calling these fraudsters. My love of helping people gave me the inspiration to create this website.
